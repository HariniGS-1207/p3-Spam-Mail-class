<p>Section 1 | The Data :
In this section we aim to do some operations on the dataset before training the model on it, processes like :

Data Loading : Load the dataset
Data Visualization : Visualize dataset features
Data Cleaning : Remove stopwords and duplicates values
Data Splitting : Split the dataset into training and testing sets

Section 2 | The Model :
The dataset is ready for training, so we create a naive classifier using scikit-learn and thin fit it to the data, and finally we evaluate the model by getting accuracy, classification report and confusion matrix</p>
